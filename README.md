# AWARE: Calls

[![Swift Package Manager compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)


The Calls sensor logs call events performed by or received by the user. It also provides higher level context on the usersâ€™ calling availability and actions.

## Requirements
iOS 13 or later

## Installation

You can integrate this framework into your project via Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) or CocoaPods.

### SwiftPM
1. Open Package Manager Windows
    * Open `Xcode` -> Select `Menu Bar` -> `File` -> `App Package Dependencies...` 

2. Find the package using the manager
    * Select `Search Package URL` and type `git@github.com:awareframework/com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls.git`

3. Import the package into your target.

4. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_calls
```

### CocoaPods
1. com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).  To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls'
```
2. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_calls
```

## Public functions

### CallsSensor

* `init(config:CallsSensor.Config?)` : Initializes the calls sensor with the optional configuration.
* `start()`: Starts the calls sensor with the optional configuration.
* `stop()`: Stops the service.

### CallsConfig

Class to hold the configuration of the sensor.

#### Fields

+ `sensorObserver: CallsObserver`: Callback for live data updates.
+ `enabled: Boolean` Sensor is enabled or not. (default = `false`)
+ `debug: Boolean` enable/disable logging to `Logcat`. (default = `false`)
+ `label: String` Label for the data. (default = "")
+ `deviceId: String` Id of the device that will be associated with the events and the sensor. (default = "")
+ `dbEncryptionKey` Encryption key for the database. (default = `null`)
+ `dbType: Engine` Which db engine to use for saving data. (default = `Engine.DatabaseType.NONE`)
+ `dbPath: String` Path of the database. (default = "aware_calls")
+ `dbHost: String` Host for syncing the database. (default = `null`)

## Broadcasts

### Fired Broadcasts

+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALL_ACCEPTED`: fired when the user accepts an incoming call.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALL_RINGING`: fired when the phone is ringing.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALL_MADE`: fired when the user is making a call.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_USER_IN_CALL`: fired when the user is currently in a call.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_USER_NOT_IN_CALL`: fired when the user is not in a call.

### Received Broadcasts

+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_START`: received broadcast to start the sensor.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_STOP`: received broadcast to stop the sensor.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_SYNC`: received broadcast to send sync attempt to the host.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_SET_LABEL`: received broadcast to set the data label. Label is expected in the `CallsSensor.EXTRA_LABEL` field of the intent extras.

## Data Representations

### Call Data

Contains the calls sensor information.

| Field          | Type   | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventTimestamp | Long   | unixtime miliseconds of the actual event                        |
| type           | String | one of call types (dialing, incoming, connected, and disconnected)|
| attributes     | String | a [call event attibutes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcall)|
| duration       | Int    | length of the call session                                      |
| trace          | String | source/target of the call                                       |
| deviceId       | String | AWARE device UUID                                               |
| label          | String | Customizable label. Useful for data calibration or traceability |
| timestamp      | Long   | unixtime milliseconds since 1970                                |
| timezone       | Int    | Timezone of the device                          |
| os             | String | Operating system of the device (ex. android)                    |

## Example Usage
```swift
let callsSensor = CallsSensor.init(CallsSensor.Config().apply{config in
    config.debug = true
    config.sensorObserver = Observer()
    config.dbType = .REALM
})
callsSensor?.start()
callsSensor?.stop()
```
```swift
class Observer:CallsObserver{
    func onCall(data: CallData) {
        // Your code here..
    }

    func onRinging(number: String?) {
        // Your code here..
    }

    func onBusy(number: String?) {
        // Your code here..
    }

    func onFree(number: String?) {
        // Your code here..
    }
}
```
