The Calls sensor logs call events performed by or received by the user. It also provides higher level context on the usersâ€™ calling availability and actions.

## Requirements
iOS 10 or later

## Installation

1. com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).  To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls'
```
2. Import com.awareframework.ios.sensor.calls library into your source code.
```swift
import com_awareframework_ios_sensor_calls
```

## Public functions

### CallsSensor

* `init(config:CallsSensor.Config?)` : Initializes the calls sensor with the optional configuration.
* `start()`: Starts the gyroscope sensor with the optional configuration.
* `stop()`: Stops the service.

## Broadcasts

### Fired Broadcasts

+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALL_ACCEPTED`: fired when the user accepts an incoming call.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALL_RINGING`: fired when the phone is ringing.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALL_MADE`: fired when the user is making a call.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_USER_IN_CALL`: fired when the user is currently in a call.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_USER_NOT_IN_CALL`: fired when the user is not in a call.

### Received Broadcasts

+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_START`: received broadcast to start the sensor.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_STOP`: received broadcast to stop the sensor.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_SYNC`: received broadcast to send sync attempt to the host.
+ `CallsSensor.ACTION_AWARE_CALLS_SET_LABEL`: received broadcast to set the data label. Label is expected in the `CallsSensor.EXTRA_LABEL` field of the intent extras.

## Data Representations

### Call Data

Contains the calls sensor information.

| Field          | Type   | Description                                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventTimestamp | Long   | unixtime miliseconds of the actual event                        |
| type           | String | one of call types (dialing, incoming, connected, and disconnected)|
| attributes     | String | a [call event attibutes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit/cxcall)|
| duration       | Int    | length of the call session                                      |
| trace          | String | source/target of the call                                       |
| deviceId       | String | AWARE device UUID                                               |
| label          | String | Customizable label. Useful for data calibration or traceability |
| timestamp      | Long   | unixtime milliseconds since 1970                                |
| timezone       | Int    | Timezone of the device                          |
| os             | String | Operating system of the device (ex. android)                    |

## Example Usage
```swift
let callsSensor = CallsSensor.init(CallsSensor.Config().apply{config in
    config.debug = true
    config.sensorObserver = Observer()
    config.dbType = .REALM
})
callsSensor?.start()
callsSensor?.stop()
```
```swift
class Observer:CallsObserver{
    func onCall(data: CallData) {
        // Your code here..
    }

    func onRinging(number: String?) {
        // Your code here..
    }

    func onBusy(number: String?) {
        // Your code here..
    }

    func onFree(number: String?) {
        // Your code here..
    }
}
```
